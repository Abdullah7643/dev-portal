SingularityNET raised funds to build out our platform during our Token Generation Event (TGE) in December 2017. We worked quickly towards building a beta platform which was release in February 2019.

[Our roadmap](https://singularitynet.io/roadmap/) contains our plans for iterating on this release, and will be updated as we make progress towards moving out of beta.

To keep abreast of SingularityNET development and platform design changes, follow the pinned repos on our [github account](https://github.com/singnet), or subscribe to our newsletter below.
