## What is blockchain

Blockchain is a public and open shared distributed ledger to enable the trust & secured transactions across the participants without any intermediatory trusted parties

Imagine this ledger as an increasing list of records called ‘blocks’ linked using a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. The public and decentralized ledger design of Blockchain enables a unified source of data with an audit trail and consistency across the transacting parties without the intermediaries.
