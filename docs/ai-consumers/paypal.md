The protofile  information associated IPFS hash are so complex to understand. But because there part of the UI, it becomes user-friendly way for the user to build their UI components around a service and host it on SingularityNET platform. 

This becomes easy for the user to the Input values that need to be sent and view the computed expected result in the Output field, even without knowing the complexity of the gRPC call and the proto that is associated to the service and so.
