The Markplace URL page which is designed by the SingularityNET, manages and displays all the information available from Marketplace database.
the SingularityNET platform is open and decentralized, the Marketplace is the SingularityNET Foundation's curated view. 

This allows the foundation to adhere to legal requirements of different legislative regions. So whenever an events resides in the local table, they need to be reviewed and approved. 

This waiting period is known as Curative process. Only after the successful it has been approved; the service becomes available in the Marketplace. 

The protofile  information associated IPFS hash are so complex to understand. But because there part of the UI, it becomes user-friendly way for the user to build their UI components around a service and host it on SingularityNET platform. 

This becomes easy for the user to the Input values that need to be sent and view the computed expected result in the Output field, even without knowing the complexity of the gRPC call and the proto that is associated to the service and so.  So when you click the Invoke button the AI service computes the result
