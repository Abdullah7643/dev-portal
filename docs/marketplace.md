The SingularityNET Marketplace provides an easy way for people browse available services and interact with them.

While SingularityNET the platform is open and decentralised, the marketplace is our curated view of it, which allows
the foundation to provide oversight and adhere to different requirements in different legislative regions.

If you want your service to be listed on the marketplace there are a number of steps involved:

0. Build your service
1. Ensure you are using SSL with the snet-daemon. We recommend using certbot and letsencrypt if you don't already have a SSL certificate.
2. [Publish your service](/tutorial/publish)
3. Fork the snet-dapp repo, build a react component for your service, and submit a pull request. Let us know what networks your service is on, and the organisation and service names used.
