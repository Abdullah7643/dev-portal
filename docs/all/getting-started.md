Welcome to the [SingularityNET Developer Portal](https://dev.singularitynet.io).

Our Developer Portal provides documentation about the SingularityNET Platform and Marketplace. You will learn how to build and access AI services that are published onto the network as a service developer or as an end-user of services that other people have published.

The Alpha Marketplace at [alpha.singularitynet.io](http://alpha.singularitynet.io), but this is quite old. We will release our beta platform in February 2019. When it's released it will be at [beta.singularitynet.io](https://beta.singularitynet.io), and close to that date you may see the site available sporadically.

If you're new to SingularityNET, this is the suggested order in which to explore the developer portal. For everyone else, it's hopefully a good index to find the information you need.
