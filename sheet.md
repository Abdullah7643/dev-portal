## AGI Token ##
SingularityNET uses the AGI Token for its marketplace. The AGI Token is an ERC-20 token hosted on the Ethereum blockchain. Right now, we are in the `alpha` phase of the SingularityNET Marketplace. That means that you will need to use Kovan Testnet AGI to work with our tools. You can get Kovan Testnet AGI by following the instructions [here](#agi-faucet).
