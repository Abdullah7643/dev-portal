Provides an interface for people to browse and interact with available AI services through web interface.


## [Request for AI Portal](https://rfai.singularitynet.io/) (RFAI) 
Allows user to request for AI services that are built and deployed onto the SingularityNET Network. Users can back requests with AGIX tokens as a reward for having a service developed. The AGIX tokens are transferred to the developer who submits a valid solution for the request.

You can list your services in the marketplace (Dapp), which can help users to search and use your service.
