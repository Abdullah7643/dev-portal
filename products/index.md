The [SingularityNET Marketplace](http://beta.singularitynet.io) provides an easy way for people browse available AI services and interact with them via a web interface.


The [Request for AI Portal](https://rfai.singularitynet.io/) (RFAI) lets users make requests for AI services that they would like to see built and deployed onto the SingularityNET Network. Users can back requests with AGI tokens as a reward for having a service developed. The AGI tokens are transferred to the developer who submits a valid solution for the request. 


The [Publisher Portal](http://workinprogress) provides an easy way for people to assist the developers easily publish and manage their organizations
and services using the publisher portal.
You can list your services on to the marketplace Dapp easily making it very simple for your users to search and use your service.
***Publisher portal will be live by March***
