# SingularityNET Developer Portal

Welcome to the SingularityNET Developer Portal! Let's build the Technological Singularity together!

The SingularityNET Developer Portal offers documentation about the SingularityNET Marketplace. You can find our portal at [dev.singularitynet.io](dev.singularitynet.io).

> SingularityNET is still under active development. The design is rapidly evolving and should be considered unstable until we release our beta platform in February 2019.

## Contributing
We are welcoming external contributions to our documentation, such as corrections, improvements, new tutorials, or other suitable additions. Please find our contribution guidelines [here](dev.singularitynet.io/contribute).

Please contribute pull requests to the master branch. In case you simply want to notify us of an issue, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/singnet/dev-portal/issues).
