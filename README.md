# SingularityNET Developer Portal

Welcome to the SingularityNET Developer Portal! Let's build the Technological Singularity together!

The SingularityNET Developer Portal offers documentation about the SingularityNET Marketplace. You can find our portal at [dev.singularitynet.io](dev.singularitynet.io) and the current Alpha Marketplace at [alpha.singularitynet.io](alpha.singularitynet.io)

> SingularityNET is still under active development. The design is rapidly evolving and should be considered unstable until we release our beta platform in February 2019.
